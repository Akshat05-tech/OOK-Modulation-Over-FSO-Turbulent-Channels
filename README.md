# OOK-Modulation-Over-FSO-Turbulent-Channels
Due to its low power consumption, high speed and high capacity, Free Space Optical (FSO) communication technology is recently gaining traction. The only hindrance in mass use of this technology is it struggles in turbulent atmosphere. Turbulent atmosphere causes scintillations, regardless of the modulation used. This project presents and compares 3 Deep Learning models for improving performance of OOK modulation over FSO channels. The 3 models are based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fully Connected Layers (FC) and Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN) respectively. The comparison among the 3 models is based on accuracy and time complexity
